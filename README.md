# 📧 Email Sender for USSC Special Election & Plebiscite

> **Easy-to-use automated email sender for election notifications and ballot distribution**

This tool helps you send professional emails to students for the USSC Special Election and Plebiscite. No coding experience needed!

---

## 🎯 What Does This Tool Do?

This program can send two types of emails:

1. **Notification Email** (`blast`) - Sent BEFORE voting day to inform students
2. **Ballot Link Email** (`ballot_links`) - Sent ON voting day with the actual voting link (one Google Form for everyone)

---

## 📋 What You'll Need

Before you start, make sure you have:

- ✅ A computer with Windows
- ✅ Python installed (version 3.7 or higher)
- ✅ A Gmail account for sending emails
- ✅ A list of student emails in a CSV file (Excel can create this)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Install Python

   - Open **Command Prompt** (search for "cmd" in Windows)
   - Type: `python --version` and press Enter
   - If you see a version number (like `Python 3.12.0`), you're good! Skip to Step 2.

2. If not installed, download Python:
   - Visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Click the big yellow button "Download Python"

---

### Step 3: Set Up Gmail App Password

**Why?** Gmail requires a special password for programs to send emails (not your regular password).

1. Go to your Gmail account settings
2. Enable **2-Step Verification** first (if not already enabled)
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Click "2-Step Verification" and follow the steps

![Project Screenshot](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=19dQO6Ohk_-jxBe2626wvnxcGoRY7Ci6C)

3. Create an **App Password**:
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Or search for "App passwords" in your Google Account settings
   - Assign name for app password, can be anything
   - Click "Create"
   - **Copy the 16-character password** (it looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

![Project Screenshot](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1h43EE2NqnMXJsH49i-FHbFg2G7HRa9UQ)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Save this password! You'll need it in the next step.

---

### Step 4: Create Your Configuration File

1. Open **Notepad** (search for "Notepad" in Windows)
2. Copy and paste this text (replace the example values with your real information):

```
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SENDER_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
ALTERNATIVE_EMAIL_FORM_LINK=https://forms.gle/YourGoogleFormLink
BALLOT_LINK=https://forms.gle/YourBallotFormLink
PRECINCT_LOCATION=Room 123, Main Building, VSU Campus
```

3. **Replace these values:**
   - `your_email@gmail.com` → Your Gmail address
   - `abcdefghijklmnop` → The 16-character App Password from Step 3 (remove spaces)
   - `https://forms.gle/YourGoogleFormLink` → Your Google Form link for alternative email requests
   - `https://forms.gle/YourBallotFormLink` → Your Google Form ballot link (same for all students)
   - `Room 123, Main Building, VSU Campus` → The actual voting precinct location

4. Save the file:
   - Click **File** → **Save As**
   - Navigate to your SEB folder (where `send.py` is located)
   - For "File name", type: `.env` (yes, with the dot at the start!)
   - For "Save as type", select: **All Files**
   - Click **Save**

### Step 5: Prepare Your Student List (CSV File)

#### For Notification Emails (Before Voting Day)

Create a file called `students.csv` with these columns:

```
email,name,student_id
juan.delacruz@vsu.edu.ph,Juan Dela Cruz,2021-12345
maria.santos@vsu.edu.ph,Maria Santos,2021-67890
```

![Project Screenshot](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1P6wsM6jTXvygUVjigHg6ji1MDXRb137C)


**How to create this in Excel:**
1. Open Excel
2. Create three columns: `email`, `name`, `student_id`
3. Fill in your student data
4. Click **File** → **Save As**
5. Choose **CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)** as the file type
6. Save it in your SEB folder as `students.csv`

---

#### For Ballot Link Emails (On Voting Day)

Use the **SAME** CSV file as notifications! The ballot link comes from your `.env` file, not the CSV.

```
email,name,student_id
juan.delacruz@vsu.edu.ph,Juan Dela Cruz,2021-12345
maria.santos@vsu.edu.ph,Maria Santos,2021-67890
```

**Note**: All students will receive the same Google Form ballot link that you configured in `BALLOT_LINK` in your `.env` file.

## 🛡️ Preventing Spam Folder Issues

If your emails are being marked as spam, try these solutions:

### **1. Send a Test Email to Yourself First**
- Always send to your own email before sending to students
- If it goes to spam, mark it as "Not Spam"
- This helps train Gmail's filters

### **2. Increase Delay Between Emails**
```bash
# Use 5 seconds between emails instead of 3
python send.py --mode batch --type blast --csv students.csv --email-delay 5

# For very cautious sending, use 10 seconds
python send.py --mode batch --type blast --csv students.csv --email-delay 10
```

### **3. Send in Smaller Batches**
- Don't send more than 50 emails at once
- Split your CSV into smaller files
- Wait 30-60 minutes between batches

### **5. Ask Recipients to Whitelist**
Tell students to:
1. Check their spam folder
2. Mark the email as "Not Spam"
3. Add `fcbaybayseb@vsu.edu.ph` to their contacts

### **6. Check Your Email Content**
- Avoid ALL CAPS in subject lines
- Don't use too many exclamation marks!!!
- Keep a good text-to-image ratio
- Include a physical address (already in footer)

### **7. Verify Your Sender Reputation**
- Use only one Gmail account for sending
- Don't switch between different accounts
- Keep your account in good standing (no violations)

## ✅ Quick Checklist Before Sending

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **NEVER share your `.env` file** - it contains your Gmail password!

- The App Password only works for this program, not for logging into your Gmail account
- You can delete App Passwords anytime from your Google Account settings
